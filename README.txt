DeepQuoter v.0.1

DeepQuoter is a simple, silly and intendedly funny jQuery 1.9 plugin meant for generating random "deep" quotes from particles taken from a JSON file. You can test it with the test.html file in the same folder, and it also comes with a test JSON file (so you can see it which structure it has and generate your own files). I was greatly surprised that even with few options, the quotes make some "deep" sense -lovely if you want to troll some hipsters.

DeepQuoter and his author, IÃ±aki Iglesias (myself), are not responsible for any social collateral damage its random quotes may cause if you use it as a pickup quote generator.

Also, take into consideration that this plugin was built upon the Spanish grammar, so it may not "work properly" in other languages. Nonsense may result, in consequence -but feel free to fix it, if you know how.
